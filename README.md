These tunes are all made in tunerpro using the xdf files from ms4x wiki, community patch list ect 
the files names Fresh ms43_430069 ect are files created and altered by me and are custom launch control and hard ignition cut rev limiter, neutral rev limiter is set at like 4k for some nice 2 step

pop and bangs is toggled by cruise control button, lanch control is toggled by holding down the minus button on the cruise control panel, can not be activated if cruise control is turned on tho

i would suggest looking into these files and checking which applies for your cars for example i have the electric fan so that config is turned on for that but also i have catless headers so thats disabled 

Disclaimer - im not responsible for anythign happenign too your vehicles ive been runnign my tunes for over 3 years now and havent damaged anything
